# 04-Web-APIs-Code-Quiz

## Description

This project is about creating a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app can run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. 

What I've learned:

* I can add a HTML page link to a <div> in another HTML page to connect two HTML.
* Use JavaScript to manipulate DOM. Use document.querySelector and getElementById to get the element in HTML and add feature in JS.
* Learn how to use "element.style.display = "none""; and "element.style.display = "initial"" to hide elements and show elements in order to display different questions and the score page.
* Use timeInterval() and clearInterval() to control the timer. Use setTimeout() to control the right/wrong result for each answer.
* Use localStorage.setItem and .getItem to store the game result in localStorage, and invoke the key value pair and manipulate in different JS page.
* window.location.href = "html.link" can direct to the linked page.
